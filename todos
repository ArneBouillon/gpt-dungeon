TODOs for `dungeon.ts`

Necessary:
- Extract enemies and add at the end
- Extract special items and add at the end
- Provide at least a rudimentary section on the dungeon's layout

Nice-to-have:
- Clarification cycles (e.g. riddles)
- Make a (basic) map of the dungeon
- Keep more context in between rooms
    > Ensure no references to later are made that don't come true (e.g. "They find a key that they will need later")
    > Create a more interconnected/integrated feeling
- Introduce more options
    > Make the keywords configurable
    > Give a "slider" for loot amount, difficulty...
- Add thread that remembers style decisions (for increased uniformity)

Ideas:
- Maybe we could provide a list with TODOs for the DM? There'll always be a few things left to fill in (and that might not even be a bad thing).
