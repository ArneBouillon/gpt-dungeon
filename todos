TODOs for `dungeon.ts`

Necessary:

Nice-to-have:
- The connections should be incorporated into the actual room descriptions.
- Description of the outside/surroundings of the dungeon to read to the players
- More/better clarification cycles (e.g. riddles)
- Generate some hidden info or underlying story beforehand, that can then be divided between the rooms
- Keep more context in between rooms
    > Ensure no references to later are made that don't come true (e.g. "They find a key that they will need later")
    > Create a more interconnected/integrated feeling
    > Should also include the hidden info above
- Introduce more options
    > Make the keywords configurable
    > Give a "slider" for loot amount, difficulty...
- Add thread that remembers style decisions (for increased uniformity)

Ideas:
- Maybe we could provide a list with TODOs for the DM? There'll always be a few things left to fill in (and that might not even be a bad thing).
- Get it to ease off on the puzzles? I think there's a bit too many of them.
