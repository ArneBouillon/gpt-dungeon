TODOs for `dungeon.ts`

Necessary:

Nice-to-have:
- The connections should be incorporated into the actual room descriptions.
- Description of the outside/surroundings of the dungeon to read to the players
- More/better clarification cycles (e.g. riddles)
- Introduce more options
    > Make the keywords configurable
    > Give a "slider" for loot amount, difficulty...
- Add thread that remembers style decisions (for increased uniformity)

Ideas:
- Maybe we could provide a list with TODOs for the DM? There'll always be a few things left to fill in (and that might not even be a bad thing).
