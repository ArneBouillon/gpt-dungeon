Necessary:
- Extract enemies and add at the end
- Extract special items and add at the end
- Provide at least a rudimentary section on the dungeon's layout

Nice-to-have:
- Clarification cycles (e.g. riddles)
- Make a (basic) map of the dungeon
- Keep more context in between rooms
    > Ensure no references to later are made that don't come true (e.g. "They find a key that they will need later")
    > Create a more interconnected/integrated feeling
