TODOs for `dungeon.ts`

Necessary:

Nice-to-have:
- Re-introduce connections
    > Generate them somehow
    > Incorporate them into room descriptions
- Room details
    > Improve clarification process
        -> Extra cycle?
        -> Even more mechanics
        -> Find a way to ensure all bullets are incorporated into the text
    > Separate sections should be more detailed
- Introduce more options
    > Make the keywords configurable
    > Give a "slider" for loot amount, difficulty...
- Add threads for style uniformity
    > Creatures, items, room details...
- Global items and creatures

Ideas:
- Maybe we could provide a list with TODOs for the DM? There'll always be a few things left to fill in (and that might not even be a bad thing).
