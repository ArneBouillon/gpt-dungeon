# Clockwork Canopy: Quest for the Timeless Bloom

Deep within the heart of an ancient forest lies the Clockwork Jungle, a breathtaking meld of vibrant overgrowth and intricate machinery. Legend speaks of the "Solstice Bloom," a clockwork flower with the power to grant its consumer an extended day. As adventurers traverse the mechanical wilderness, they'll encounter a unique blend of nature and technology, from mechanical wildlife to the ancient guardians known as the Gearshift Druids. Challenges like time-altering flora and druidic traps will test their wit and courage. However, the most significant challenge awaits in the Gearscape Sanctum, where the coveted Solstice Bloom resides.

## Motivation
There are many reasons why the PCs might embark on this quest. Some examples are given.

1. A terminally ill party member seeks the Solstice Bloom's nectar to extend their life and fulfill a personal quest.
2. A powerful, time-manipulating artifact is rumored to be hidden within the sanctum, and the characters aim to claim it for their own use.
3. The characters have been hired by a wealthy collector obsessed with acquiring the rarest and most unique botanical specimens.
4. A rival adventuring group seeks the Solstice Bloom's power, and the characters accept the mission to prevent their rivals from gaining an advantage.
5. A local village is suffering from a severe drought, and the characters hope the Solstice Bloom's nectar can restore their withering crops and save the community.

## Background
Nestled deep within the heart of the Clockwork Jungle, the Gearscape Sanctum stands as a testament to a time where nature, mechanics, and time itself intertwined. Crafted by the brilliant artificer Arvandus in a pact with the Elemental Clock Spirits, this sanctum was meant to preserve the fragile balance of time within the jungle. The ancient tree concealing its entrance is both a guardian and a symbol of the pact.

The reclusive Gearshift Druids, keepers of the sanctum, are descendants of those who've committed their lives to maintaining the harmony between the mechanical and the organic. With the power of both technology and nature at their fingertips, these druids have ensured that the delicate machinery of the jungle ticks in rhythm with the beating heart of its flora and fauna.

Chronarb, the ethereal guardian spirit, stands watch over the sanctum. A fusion of the past and the present, Chronarb knows every secret corridor and chamber of the sanctum and has a deep connection with the Elemental Clock Spirits. His primary duty is to protect the sanctum and its secrets, especially the coveted Solstice Bloom.

The Solstice Bloom is no mere legend. This clockwork flower, with its ability to manipulate the very essence of time, holds immeasurable power. But it's not just the promise of extended days that it offers; the bloom is the very heart of the sanctum, its rhythms synchronizing with the mechanisms that keep the jungle's time in check.

As the adventurers delve deeper into the sanctum, they'll uncover the intricate balance that holds this world together â€“ the dance of gears and roots, the whispers of spirits long gone, and the ever-ticking heart of a jungle where time never truly stands still.

## Arrival
*As the adventurers approach the entrance to the Clockwork Jungle, the air grows thick with humidity and the faint scent of oil. Vibrant green leaves intertwine with gleaming brass, giving the forest a shimmering, golden hue. Sounds of ticking and the distant hum of gears mesh seamlessly with the chirps of unseen creatures. Before them stands a grand archway, nature and mechanism in perfect harmony. Vines draped with glowing bioluminescent flowers cascade down the sides of the arch, and in the center, an intricate clockwork butterfly hovers. As it flits towards them, the entrance behind the archway slowly grinds open, revealing the Time-Warped Thicket and the beginning of their adventure.*

## Dungeon layout
The dungeon's rooms are laid out as follows.

![layout](TODO) {height:280px,mix-blend-mode:multiply}

## Room 1: The Time-Warped Thicket

*As you step into Room 1, you find yourself in a dense forested chamber with towering trees, their bark embedded with metal. The leaves on these trees shimmer with bioluminescence, casting the room in perpetual twilight. The occasional glint of a gear or metallic creature catches your eye among the trees. The omnipresent sound of ticking fills the room.*

### Description
The room is filled with towering trees, their trunks a curious blend of organic wood and metallic elements. Clockwork vines crisscross the forest floor, and streams flow in reverse at times, defying the laws of nature. The ground is uneven, with patches of quicksand-like pits hidden beneath the forest floor. Inscriptions on tree trunks read, "Tales of Druids tending to this thicket, where time bends yet refuses to break."

## Room 2: The Cogwork Clearing

*As you enter, you find yourselves in a spacious room where large interlocking gears form the floor, walls, and ceiling. The gears periodically shift, altering the room's layout. Steam rises from random gaps, and the greenish glow of the forest beyond the gears hints at the transition between the forest and the sanctum.*

### Description
The Cogwork Clearing is a room dominated by massive interlocking gears. The central gear, in particular, stands out, requiring rotation to align with doorways leading to other parts of the sanctum. Beware of unpredictable steam geysers that make the rotation perilous. An Elemental Clock Spirit hovers around the central gear, guarding it aggressively.




### Notable Features
- Massive interlocking **gears** shape the room, periodically moving to reshape the layout. Steam emanates from gaps between them.
- The room is illuminated by a greenish glow from the forest outside.
- A **blueprint** found here shows the sanctum's main gear mechanisms and a path to the Orrery room.
- The **massive central gear** is pivotal, requiring alignment to access other doorways. Rotation needs strength and timing.
- **Steam geysers** erupt periodically, corresponding to the ticking of the gears. Players must time their movements to avoid steam bursts.
- **Elemental Clock Spirit** hovers near the central gear, becoming aggressive if tampered with. Accompanied by three **Steam Sprites**.
- Etchings of **Chronarb** on some gears hint at his role in the sanctum.
- Shadowy figures occasionally pass outside the room, dimming the lighting.
- **Temporal Dagger** embedded in one of the gears, retrieval requires stopping the gear.
- Between two gears is a nest containing six **Clockwork Scarabs**. Disturbance leads to aggression.
- Secluded gear bears the etched quote: "The tick precedes the tock, as does the past guide the future."
- Rusted chest contains the **Robe of Gearing**.
- Murals on walls depicting time-themed tales.
- Fading images occasionally appear in the steam, suggesting past events.
- Overhead, a large **pendulum** swings, which can be climbed to access higher platforms.
- Connection to **Room 1 (Time-Warped Thicket)** via a left path.
- Straight path leads to **Room 4 (Chronarb's Chamber)**.
- Heavy moss-covered door on the right leads to **Room 5 (Orrery of Alignments)**.

- Gear-embroidered **cloth** concealed in a chest among mechanisms.
- **Chrono-Echo** displaying past druids building a cogwork bridge, hinting at bridge construction method.

### Central Gear Puzzle
To access other rooms, players must align the central gear. This requires:
- Finding large levers hidden behind a wall panel.
- Timing their actions with the rhythmic steam geysers to avoid injury. Wrong timing can lead to player injuries.

### Clockwork Butterfly Mechanism
Upon placing the **clockwork butterfly** from Room 1 on the pillar:
- Hidden compartments open, revealing rare gemstones and a **temporal compass**.
  
### Chrono-Echo Bridge Insight
Observation of the **Chrono-Echo** provides:
- Knowledge on constructing a bridge using cog mechanisms.
- Emphasis on the cogwork mechanisms for the bridge.
  
### Temporal Tincture Interaction
The gear-embroidered **cloth** emits a soft glow when near the statue in Room 3. Draping it over reveals a hidden cavity containing the **Temporal Tincture**.

### Crafting Time-Altering Items
In the room, a workbench with specialized tools allows for:
- Crafting of items using **Temporal Shards** with gear components. Example: Combining shards with gear components crafts a **Temporal Amulet** allowing a reroll once per long rest.



#### Artificer's Touch Gloves
*Weight:* 0.5 pounds
*Value:* 250 gold pieces

These gloves allow the wearer to momentarily stop a single gear or mechanism upon touch, rendering it immobile for one minute. This feature can be used once per short rest.

*Value:* 25 gold pieces

This sprig of temporal flora, when crushed, emits an aroma that allows the user to briefly relive a past memory. The user can choose to experience a specific memory related to their past, gaining insight or information from that moment. This effect can be used once per day and lasts for 1d4 minutes.

#### Robe of Gearing
*Weight:* 4 pounds
*Value:* 500 gold pieces

When worn, this robe meshes with the room's interlocking gears, rendering the wearer nearly invisible within the Cogwork Clearing (Room 2). While blending in with the gears, the wearer gains advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can move through the room without triggering the Steam Sprites' aggression.

#### Temporal Tincture
*Weight:* 0.5 pounds
*Value:* 150 gold pieces

This vial of Temporal Tincture, when consumed, allows the user to take an additional turn during their next combat round, immediately after their regular turn. This effect can be used once per long rest.

*As you enter Room 3, you find yourself in a serene glade bathed in the soft glow of luminescent flora. A central pond reflects the shimmering light of moving gears overhead, creating a tranquil yet mechanical ambiance. The rhythmic sounds of chirping birds blend with the steady ticking of machinery. Statues of Druids are scattered throughout the glade, appearing frozen in time.*

### Description
The Gearshift Glade is a circular chamber with a radius of 40 feet. The luminescent flora covers the walls, ceiling, and floor, bathing the room in an eerie, shifting light. In the center, a pond of clear water spans 20 feet in diameter, mirroring the mechanical gears above. Druid statues, each about 6 feet tall, are positioned around the room. The medallion with the emblem of the sun, moon, and gear is hanging from a tree near the pond.

A stone bench sits near the pond's edge, offering a resting spot. Hidden among the flora, you spot a rare "Glowing Fern." Mechanical fireflies float around, emitting dim light, and a curious squirrel-like creature made of wood and metal scurries about.




### Notable Features
- A luminescent flora-covered environment with mechanical components.
- A central reflective pond underneath moving gears overhead.
- Sounds of ticking blending with chirping.
- Scattered statues of **Druid** frozen mid-gesture:
  - One statue, near the pond, suggests an offering action.
  - Another holds a **Chain of Binding**.
  - A worn statue at the room's edge shows wear marks from frequent draping; it conceals a **Temporal Tincture**.
- Overhead rotating gears casting fleeting shadow patterns hinting at Druidic rituals.
- An ornate stone bench allowing brief respite.
- A squirrel-like creature, constructed of wood and metal, scurrying about.
- **Bronze Sentinel** stationed near the pond.
- Mechanical fireflies floating throughout the room.
- "Chrono-Echo" of a past Druidic ritual near the pond's edge.
- A hidden gear beneath moss.
- Connection paths:
  - Overgrown vines lead to the **Time-Warped Thicket** (Room 1).
  - A portal-like doorway to **Chronarb's Chamber** (Room 4) activates when a small item is cast into the pond.
  
### Chrono-Echo Interaction
- Players witnessing the "Chrono-Echo" see a Druidic ritual. Druids, in the echo, make specific gestures and present offerings to pacify steam-powered creatures.
- Verbatim phrase from the echo: "By the light of sun and moon, we offered gear and heart, and the creatures stilled." Players learning this ritual can use it in subsequent encounters.

### Pond Mechanics
- Approaching the pond with genuine intention to offer activates a shimmer in the waters.
- Randomly discarding an item into the pond or neglecting to offer activates the **Time-Touched Treant**.
- Casting a small item into the pond activates the portal to **Chronarb's Chamber** (Room 4) for 1 minute.

### Stone Bench Rest
- Characters resting on the stone bench recover a minor amount of health or spell slots.

### Statue Interaction
- Draping the **gear-embroidered cloth** from **The Cogwork Clearing** (Room 2) over the worn statue reveals a cavity containing a **Temporal Tincture**.
- Inscription on the druid statue reads: "Follow the flutter to unveil riches beneath timeâ€™s wings."

### Squirrel-like Creature Behavior
- Depending on its mood, the creature either leads players to minor hidden loot or potential dangers.

### Room Connections and Sequences
- The shimmering clockwork butterfly from **The Time-Warped Thicket** (Room 1) leads players to **The Cogwork Clearing** (Room 2) to be placed on a stone pillar, revealing hidden compartments. Hints about this sequence are available within **The Gearshift Glade** (Room 3).
- Conversations overheard among Gearshift Druids, whispers, and rustling leaves provide clues to treasures in the room and the sequence involving the gear-embroidered cloth and the statue.

## Room 4: Chronarb's Chamber

*As you step into Chronarb's Chamber, you are greeted by a grand circular room. The massive clock face occupying the ceiling casts a faint, omnipresent hum that resonates with the passage of time. The clock hands slowly rotate, and the walls are adorned with murals depicting the pact between Arvandus and the Elemental Clock Spirits. In the center of the room, a platform holds Chronarb, a fusion of mechanical and organic elements. Hovering orbs representing different time periods surround Chronarb, and echoes of past visitors occasionally materialize as translucent apparitions replaying their moments in the chamber.*

### Description

Chronarb's Chamber is a circular room with a central platform where Chronarb resides. The massive clock face on the ceiling dominates the room, its hands slowly moving. The walls are covered in murals showcasing the pact between Arvandus and the Elemental Clock Spirits. Various small, intricate hourglasses are scattered around the room, some of which can slow or speed up time when flipped. Statues of famed timekeepers and horologists are present, each holding a unique chronometer.

In one corner, there's a pedestal with an "Eon Egg" that briefly shows a potential future version of the holder. Another corner houses a "Clockwork Scarab" defending a stash of "Temporal Coins," which offer glimpses into past or future events. Suspended in mid-air, you'll find a few "Moments in Time" scenarios that provide emotions from past events when touched. A display case contains "Time-Worn Gauntlets" that allow interaction with the "Moments in Time," and a "Chrono-Cloak" grants the wearer an advantage in evading attacks.




### Notable Features
- Grand **circular room** with a **massive clock face** on the ceiling, hands of which slowly rotate.
- Walls adorned with murals illustrating the pact between Arvandus and the **Elemental Clock Spirits**.

- Shard from the ceiling's clock face present, fitting into the **Orrery's** puzzle in Room 5.
- **Temporal Treads** lie on the central platform next to Chronarb.
- A **Mechanical Firefly** encased in a small cage on a pedestal to the left of the entrance.
- Ethereal winds occasionally distort the room's ambiance, giving a sensation of time displacement.
- 12 statues of famed timekeepers, one of which depicts **Lysandra Tempus** holding a unique hourglass with a hidden compartment containing **Temporal Sands**.
- A "Timekeeper's Tome" resting on a stone pedestal beside Lysandra Tempus' statue. An inscription reads, "Heed the lessons of the past, for they are the foundation of the future."
- A pedestal in the northwest corner holds an **Eon Egg**.

### Portal Mechanism
- Message inscribed on stone beside the portal reads, "Offer token to ever-turning waters."
- Activated by casting a small item, such as a coin, into the reflective pond in Gearshift Glade.
- Portal remains active for a duration of 10 minutes.

### Temporal Disturbances
- Intermittent ethereal winds create auditory distortions, making it difficult to discern sounds. Mechanically, any auditory Perception checks made within the room are at a disadvantage.
- The **Clockwork Scarab** aggressively protects its stash of **Temporal Coins**. When provoked, it releases an ear-piercing screech, forcing any creature within a 10-foot radius to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be stunned for 1 round.
- Faded journal beside the scarab's stash mentions, "Beware birds with clocks."

### Moments in Time Interaction
- The inscription near these moments reads, "Feel echoes of time's emotions, can't alter path."
- Characters who touch these moments experience emotions from the past, with no direct mechanical effect. However, using the **Time-Worn Gauntlets** allows a character to interact physically with these moments for up to 1 minute. Recharge after a short rest.
  
### Temporal Sands
- Inside the hidden compartment of the hourglass held by Lysandra Tempus' statue, players find a vial of **Temporal Sands**. 
- Mechanically, these sands enhance time-related spells or items, granting advantages on saving throws or extending the durations of their effects.



#### Eon Egg
* Weight: 1 pound
* Value: 250 gold pieces

This mystical egg, when held, grants the user a brief glimpse of their potential future self, allowing them to see a single, significant future event as if through a brief vision. This effect lasts for 1 minute.

#### Temporal Coin
* Weight: Negligible
* Value: 10 gold pieces

When flipped, this coin reveals a brief historical scene related to the past or future. The viewer gains insights into significant events, but these glimpses are limited to 1 minute in duration.

#### Temporal Sand
* Weight: Negligible
* Value: 50 gold pieces

Temporal Sand can be used to enhance time-related spells or items, granting advantage on saving throws related to time manipulation and extending the duration of such effects by 1 round.

## Room 5: The Orrery of Alignments

*As you step into the vast domed chamber, your eyes are drawn to the center where a complex orrery dominates the space. Clockwork planets revolve around a radiant sun, casting mesmerizing shadows on the walls that emit a soft bioluminescent glow. Consoles with slots, dials, and levers surround the orrery, and an engraved rod rests on one of them. The room is comfortably warm, thanks to the radiant sun's gentle heat. Spectral stardust clusters float through the air, whispering ancient legends when touched.*

### Description
The Orrery of Alignments is a circular chamber with a high domed ceiling. In the center stands the elaborate orrery, a metallic structure resembling a miniature solar system. The walls are adorned with intricate mosaics depicting celestial events, and small constellations form and dissipate in the bioluminescent glow. A slowly rotating nebula hovers near the celestial mural on the western wall.

Several consoles with various controls are spread around the room. One of them holds an engraved rod instrumental in activating the Solstice Bloom chamber. A hidden compartment in the floor mosaic conceals tiny meteorites. Suspended in the air is a Celestial Compass, softly glowing.

## Room 6: Chamber of the Solstice Bloom

*As you enter Room 6, you find yourself in a serene, circular chamber bathed in a soft, golden hue. The room is illuminated by floating luminescent orbs near the ceiling, their colors pulsing brighter as you move. The walls are adorned with intricate gear patterns that move slowly, creating a mesmerizing dance. At the center of the room, on a raised dais, stands the Solstice Bloom, a stunning clockwork flower with petals made of gold and silver. The air is filled with the sound of ticking, reminiscent of a heartbeat, and whispers occasionally recite lines from old tales about time, memories, and dreams.*

### Description
The circular chamber spans about 30 feet in diameter. The walls are covered in ornate gear patterns that slowly rotate, creating an enchanting display. At the center of the room is a raised circular dais, about 10 feet in diameter, where the Solstice Bloom stands. Small alcoves beside the Solstice Bloom hold vials labeled "Drops of Dilated Dawn."

A lectern near the edge of the room holds an ancient scroll written by Arvandus, providing insight into the pact made with Elemental Clock Spirits and the birth of the Clockwork Jungle. Adjacent to the scroll, in another alcove, is an ornate, feathered quill that writes in shimmering ink. On a plush cushion near a beautifully crafted sundial, you spot a pocket watch that tracks the most significant moment in its holder's life.

In one corner, an unassuming wall slot emits a faint clock-like ticking sound, and tiny clock engravings around it hint at its time-related nature. Lurking in the shadows, a Chrono Wraith remains hidden, ready to protect the sanctity of the chamber if its balance is severely disrupted.




### Notable Features
- **Raised dais** at the center with the **Solstice Bloom**, a clockwork flower with golden and silver petals. A slot for an **Engraved Rod** is on its pedestal.
- Walls are decorated with intricate **gear-patterned walls** that move slowly. An inscription reads: "Unlock flower's secret with clock's hand."
- **Floating luminescent orbs** drift near the ceiling, changing colors in response to nearby beings.
- **Golden Hourglass** in a corner with sands flowing upward.
- Whispering voices can be heard, reciting old tales about time and memories.
- **Sundial** on one side, revealing hidden constellations when light strikes it from a specific angle.
- Alcoves with vials named **Drops of Dilated Dawn** beside the **Solstice Bloom**.
- **Ancient Scroll** by Arvandus on a lectern near the edge. Its text: "In the age of alignment, the pact was sealed with the Elemental Clock Spirits. Their essence brought forth the Clockwork Jungle. Remember, traveler, balance in all things keeps the cogs turning. There exist other sanctums and pacts, portals to even more clockwork realms."
- **Chrono-Echo** depicting a failed attempt to harvest the Solstice Bloom.
- **Chrono Wraith** lurking in shadows, appearing when the room's balance is disrupted or **Solstice Bloom** is accessed unauthorized.
- **Feathered quill** in an alcove adjacent to the scroll, with a hidden compartment beneath it containing the **Solstice Bloom Engraved Rod**.
- **Pocket watch** on a plush cushion near the sundial.
- **Time-touched gloves** in an ornate box.
- **Bookstand** with a tome titled "Echoes of Eternity".
- An **unassuming wall slot** emitting a faint ticking sound.

- Mechanical Effect: Allows manipulation of time once during the character's stay in the room.
  - Slowing time: grants advantage on attacks for one minute.
  - Speeding time: reduces potion cooldowns by half for one minute or can make plants grow instantly.

### The Solstice Bloom Mechanism
- Inserting the **Solstice Bloom Engraved Rod** allows safe harvesting of the **Solstice Bloom's** nectar.
- Unauthorized touching resets character's last 10 minutes of actions.
- Inserting the **Clock Hand Tool** into the dais slot and turning clockwise reveals **time-dilated quiver** (10 arrows, +2 attack). 
- **Chrono Wraith** appears and attacks if **Solstice Bloom** is accessed without the rod.

### The Chrono-Echo
- Shows a translucent scene of a figure unsuccessfully attempting to pluck petals from the **Solstice Bloom** without the rod.



#### Solstice Bloom Engraved Rod

- **Weight:** 1 lb
- **Value:** 100 gp

This intricately engraved rod, when inserted into the Solstice Bloom, allows for the safe harvesting of its nectar. Without it, touching the Solstice Bloom triggers a temporal trap, resetting the last 10 minutes of actions in the chamber.

#### Drop of Dilated Dawn

- **Weight:** Negligible
- **Value:** 50 gp

These vials contain a rare elixir that can manipulate the length of rests for the party, either extending or shortening them. When consumed, one vial can either double the effects of a short rest or halve the effects of a long rest for the user.

#### Time-Touched Glove

- **Weight:** Negligible
- **Value:** 200 gp

These gloves allow the wearer to interact with intangible or out-of-phase objects for one minute once per long rest. During this time, the wearer can touch, manipulate, or activate such objects as if they were tangible.

#### Clock Hand Tool

- **Weight:** Negligible
- **Value:** 50 gp

This small tool, found in the Orrery of Alignments, fits perfectly into the slot on the dais in the Chamber of the Solstice Bloom. When turned clockwise, it activates the safe access to the Solstice Bloom's nectar, preventing the activation of the temporal trap.

#### Golden Hourglass

- **Weight:** 2 lbs
- **Value:** 500 gp

Interacting with this hourglass transports characters into a vision of the past, revealing the ritual that created the chamber. Mechanically, it allows manipulation of time in the room once during the character's stay.

**Time Manipulation.** Once per turn, as a reaction to being hit by a melee attack, the wraith can briefly freeze time, causing the attacker to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.

**Actions**
**Life Drain.** *Melee Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) necrotic damage.

The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

}}

## Conclusion
Upon completing their mission, the Clockwork Jungle responds to their success. The machinery, once sporadically active, now synchronizes, causing the entire forest to hum in harmonious rhythm. The once-hostile mechanical wildlife seems more docile, possibly recognizing the adventurers' achievements. As for the Solstice Bloom's nectar, when consumed, it grants the user the sensation of an extended day, experiencing 48 hours in a single day. This can be a boon for spellcasters, allowing them additional time for spell preparations or for those who need the extra hours for crafting and other activities. The Clockwork Jungle, while still holding many mysteries, now respects the adventurers, offering a serene and safe haven should they ever return.
