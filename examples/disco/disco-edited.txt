# Disco Delve: Groovin in the Eldergrove Groove

In the heart of the bioluminescent Eldergrove jungle lies the enigmatic dungeon known as Eldergrove Groove. A rhythmically charged and magical realm, adventurers face a world where traditional combat takes a backseat, and dance battles rule supreme. Musical puzzles, groovy traps, and mischievous raver elf ghosts pepper their path. Their ultimate goal: to secure DJ Lyraxia's final, unreleased track - a piece of music with power beyond comprehension.

## Motivation
There are many reasons why the PCs might embark on this quest. Some examples are given.

1. One character's uncle, a legendary raver elf, vanished in Eldergrove Groove years ago. They hope to uncover the truth behind his disappearance and potentially reunite with him.

2. The party's bard has heard rumors of DJ Lyraxia's unreleased track and believes it could be the ultimate masterpiece to boost their own music career.

3. A mischievous trickster deity has promised a character an artifact of immense power in exchange for retrieving DJ Lyraxia's vinyl.

4. A local tavern owner in a nearby town has offered the party a lifetime supply of their famous neon-colored cocktails if they bring back a sample of the Neon Nectar.

5. The party's rogue has a strange fascination with glow-ups and sees consuming the Neon Nectar as the ultimate challenge.

## Background
Nestled deep within the heart of the bioluminescent jungle lies the forgotten nightclub, Eldergrove Groove. Crafted from pure enchantment and passion, the club was the brainchild of the elf bard, DJ Lyraxia. Combining her love for music with powerful eldritch magics, she tapped into the mystical energies of the jungle to create the ultimate dance experience. Eldergrove Groove was once a beacon of revelry, attracting raver elves and creatures from all over, drawn to the irresistible beats and rhythms pulsating from within its walls.
\column
However, as with all tales of great power and allure, the club's popularity was its own undoing. As the legend goes, Lyraxia was working on her magnum opus, a track so enchanting that it held the power to bend wills and alter destinies. Concerned about its potency, Lyraxia vanished, hiding herself and the track deep within the club's confines. The club itself, with its intoxicating energies, began to merge with the very fabric of the jungle, intertwining with its vibrant flora and fauna.

The disco-dancing jaguars, native to the bioluminescent jungle, appointed themselves as the guardians of this legendary establishment. Infused with the club's magic, they became the rhythm-keepers, ensuring that Lyraxia's legacy remained undisturbed. The spirits of the raver elves who once frequented Eldergrove Groove continue their eternal celebration, their luminous forms dancing away, oblivious to the passage of time.

Recent rumors hint at the club's existence and Lyraxia's legendary unreleased track's potential discovery. As these whispers circulate, the allure of Eldergrove Groove is rekindled, beckoning adventurers to uncover its neon-lit secrets.

However, the journey is not for the faint-hearted. While the magical essence of the club welcomes dance and revelry, it fiercely protects its core, ensuring that only those truly worthy can lay their hands on Lyraxia's masterpiece. Intruders can expect to face rhythmic challenges, playful raver elf spirits, and the ever-watchful gaze of the disco-dancing jaguars. But for those who can sync their hearts to the beat of the jungle, the rewards are beyond imagination.

## Arrival
*As the adventurers approach the entrance, a pulsating, multicolored glow emanates from deep within the foliage, casting dancing shadows on the forest floor. The chirping of distant jungle creatures harmonizes with faint, ethereal beats that seem to beckon them closer. Before them stands a massive, age-worn stone door adorned with intricate musical symbols. The door appears heavy, but as they approach, it slowly starts to shift open, revealing a cavernous opening. Beyond the door, the Glowworm Grotto awaits, illuminating the path forward with its soft, luminescent light.*

## Room 3: Boogie Bridge Crossing

*As you enter Room 3, you find yourself at the edge of a vast chasm. A series of 12 floating, luminescent stepping stones stretch across the gap, emitting a soft pulsating light to a rhythmic beat. The chasm below is shrouded in darkness, and haunting melodies echo faintly from its depths. Abandoned dance shoes are scattered on the edge of the chasm, some of them tapping or moving slightly on their own, as if eager to dance. An old diary rests on a cushioned bench, and a neon sign hangs midway, flashing intermittently with the words: "Keep Groovin', Keep Movin'."*

### Description

Room 3 is a challenging crossing over a wide chasm filled with floating stepping stones. The stones emit a rhythmic "1-2-3, 1-2-3" beat of soft pulsating light, with 12 stones forming a zigzag pattern. Characters must jump from stone to stone, following the rhythm to cross safely. Stepping out of rhythm causes the stone to dim and become intangible, risking a fall into the abyss.

Throughout the room, you'll find the remnants of raver elves' revelry. Abandoned dance shoes, some with a desire to dance, are scattered on the chasm's edge. The walls are adorned with dance-themed graffiti showcasing raver elves' signatures and doodles, while glowing moss and fungi react to specific musical frequencies. Occasionally, a spectral apparition of a dancing elf follows the rhythm perfectly before vanishing.

Notably, there's a cushioned bench with an old diary that reads, "Day 45: Still can't get the rhythm right. Those shoes sure look tempting, though!" A neon sign flashes with the message: "Keep Groovin', Keep Movin'." Near the entrance, a "Harmonizing Harp" awaits, which, when played, synchronizes the pulse of all stepping stones to a uniform rhythm for 10 minutes. Hidden beneath a loose stone, you can discover a "Rhythmic Ring" that vibrates when the wearer is out of rhythm.




### Notable Features
- A vast chasm spans the room.
- 12 **floating stones** arranged in a zigzag pattern span the chasm. These emit a soft pulsating light to the rhythm of "1-2-3, 1-2-3".
- A sign hanging near the bridge reads: "Remember the rhythm, or take a swim!"
- Soft, haunting melodies echo from the chasm.
- Abandoned **dance shoes** scattered near the chasm's edge occasionally tap or move on their own.

- Glowing moss and fungi on the walls brighten when specific musical frequencies hit them.
\page
- Spectral apparitions of dancing elves sometimes cross the chasm, vanishing upon completion.
- A **Disco Dusk Sprite** floats near the stepping stones, particularly targeting those out of rhythm.
- Ethereal fireflies hover in the air, producing melodic hums that align with the stepping stone rhythm.
- An old, cushioned bench sits on one side of the chasm with an aged diary on it. It reads, "Day 45: Still can't get the rhythm right. Those shoes sure look tempting, though!"
- An old jukebox near the exit plays melodies mimicking the rhythm of the stepping stones when activated.
- Bubbles occasionally rise from the abyss. Popping them releases a pleasant aroma and a note reading, "Keep dancing, never stop!"
- During the Lunar Luminescence Phase, the bridge turns semi-translucent, revealing ancient runes in a concentric circle pattern. Walking this rune pattern grants agility enhancements.
- A worn-out dance ribbon from Neon Nectar Nook (Room 2) and a small neon sign from midway, reading "Keep Groovin', Keep Movin'," can also be found here.

### Stepping Stone Mechanics
- Adventurers must jump from stone to stone in the "1-2-3, 1-2-3" rhythm to cross safely.
- Stones dim and become intangible when stepped on out of rhythm, causing the risk of falling.
- Using the **Harmonizing Harp** synchronizes all stepping stones to the same pulse for 10 minutes.
  
### Lunar Luminescence Phase Rune Pattern
- The revealed rune pattern during this phase consists of glowing glyphs within concentric circles.
- Adventurers who walk this rune pattern gain a +2 bonus to Dexterity rolls for one hour.

### Clues and Interactions
- Observing the bridge during the Lunar Luminescence Phase reveals the rune pattern to adventurers.
- The note left behind with the **Bubbly Boots of Bouncing** on the bridge reads: "Lost my boots here. Bounced too high near jaguars."
- The engraved text on the **Rhythmic Ring** reads: "Find your groove or face the abyss."
- The **Disco Dusk Sprite** has an ability called "Disco Distraction." When used, it creates multiple illusory images of the stepping stones. Adventurers must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be disoriented.
- Spectral raver elf apparitions occasionally whisper: "Jive's jewel could reveal more near shimmering waters," hinting at the presence and use of the Jaguar Jewel of Jamming in the dungeon.

* Value: 1,500 gp

#### Rhythmic Ring

* Weight: 0.1 lb
* Value: 750 gp

When worn, this ring vibrates slightly to warn the wearer when they are out of rhythm while navigating the floating stepping stones, providing a tactile signal to help them stay in sync and avoid falling.

## Room 4: The Jagged Jaguar Jungle Room

*As you enter Room 4, you find yourself in a sprawling, mist-covered, bioluminescent forest. The air is filled with the hypnotic sounds of the jungle, and the soft beats of the drums create a mesmerizing ambiance. Glowing vines hang from the trees, and oversized luminescent mushrooms dot the landscape. Occasional shimmering lights resembling jaguar eyes catch your attention.*

### Description
The room is a lush jungle filled with towering trees and dense undergrowth. The ground is covered in soft moss, making it comfortable to walk on. Glowing vines drape from the trees, illuminating the surroundings with an ethereal green light. Oversized luminescent mushrooms, some as tall as a person, grow sporadically throughout the area.

In one corner of the room, you notice a shimmering pond, its waters reflecting the room's luminescence. There's a small tree trunk table with symbols carved into its surface, representing different dance moves. An abandoned dance floor with imprinted steps sits nearby, possibly used for dance lessons. A neon hammock is strung between two glowing trees, providing a resting spot for weary dancers.

As you explore further, you come across shimmering footprints that appear and vanish, leading you on a whimsical dance pattern across the room. The canopy above hides a cleverly disguised vine ladder, serving as a shortcut to the Hall of Holographic Histories (Room 7), but its presence is currently concealed.

## Room 7: Hall of Holographic Histories

*As you step into Room 7, the Hall of Holographic Histories, you're immediately enveloped in a nostalgic atmosphere. The expansive hall is adorned with shimmering, translucent surfaces that project holographic visuals. The walls come alive with past raves, dance-offs, and memories from the Eldergrove Groove era, and the sounds of laughter, cheers, and beats echo through the room. A central dance platform beckons, and various relics from past events, like wristbands and fading flyers, scatter the floor. A shimmering curtain hides a Cosmic Coatroom, and a spectral bartender serves Phantom Fizz.*

### Description
The Hall of Holographic Histories is a vast, glittering space filled with holographic projections that showcase the vibrant history of Eldergrove Groove. The holograms initially appear scrambled, with fragmented dancers, colors, and flashes, making them incomprehensible. Holographic projectors mounted throughout the room are the source of these scrambled stories.

In the center of the hall stands a dance platform, and nearby, you'll find scattered wristbands from past events, including the "Waltzing Werebeast Weekend" and "Pixie Pop Party." Fading flyers from legendary parties like the "Starstruck Serenade Soiree," "GrooveFest Gala," and "Neon Nights Nostalgia" are scattered across the floor, providing glimpses of legendary songs and dance moves.

A shimmering curtain hides the entrance to the Cosmic Coatroom, where a Disco-ball Shield can be discovered. A spectral bartender serves up Phantom Fizz, a drink that temporarily enhances agility.

## Conclusion
Upon securing DJ Lyraxia's legendary track, the rhythm of the Eldergrove Groove synchronizes in celebration. The spectral forms of raver elves and other creatures bow in respect, recognizing the adventurers' mastery of the dance. The dungeon, once alive with challenges and tricks, now serves as a peaceful beacon of dance and music in the heart of the jungle. The vinyl itself, when played outside the dungeon, has the power to influence and mesmerize creatures, but its true strength remains in its ability to unite souls in the joy of dance.
