# Mycelium Mirrors: The Celestial Spore Quest

Deep within an ancient, subterranean mushroom forest lies the enigmatic Mushroom Observatory. Here, towering Mycelium Telescopes stand sentinel, allowing scholarly mycologists to study Fungal Constellations and the cosmos through Cosmic Spore Bursts. Crafted by the visionary mycologist Elyndra Stellarspore, the observatory bridges the realms of fungi and stars. Adventurers will face challenges ranging from navigating the ever-shifting Mycelium Maze, to time distortions under the Spacetime Shrooms, to battling guardians of the cosmic realm. At its core, this module is a quest for the Mycocelestial Elixir, a potion with the power to heal reality itself.

## Motivation
There are many reasons why the PCs might embark on this quest. Some examples are given.

1. A prophecy foretells that the tear in their home realm is expanding rapidly, endangering their loved ones and everything they hold dear.

2. The characters seek to gain the Mycocelestial Elixir's incredible power to restore a fallen comrade's life, who was sacrificed to save the party in a previous adventure.

3. Rumors spread of a nefarious cult attempting to harness the elixir's power for destructive purposes, motivating the party to prevent this catastrophe.

## Background
The Mushroom Observatory was established centuries ago by the visionary mycologist, Elyndra Stellarspore. She sought to understand the deep connection between the universe's cosmic events and the world of fungi. Together with her Circle of Fungi, a group of dedicated scholars and mycologists, she founded the observatory amidst a vast subterranean mushroom forest.

Elyndra made groundbreaking discoveries, such as the correlation between Fungal Constellations and major cosmic phenomena. The Mycelium Telescopes, her unique creation, don't merely observe the universe but can connect one's consciousness to distant galaxies. The Cosmic Spore Bursts are the results of significant celestial events that, when captured and studied, reveal vast knowledge about the cosmos.

While the observatory was once buzzing with researchers, a catastrophic event led to its abandonment. A tear in the fabric of reality threatened the very essence of their world, causing panic and chaos. Elyndra, in her final days, prophesied the brewing of the Mycocelestial Elixir, a solution that could mend the rift. However, with her passing, the recipe was lost.

Today, the observatory remains mostly deserted but is still alive with remnants of Elyndra's work. Luminary mycologists, Funguardians, and sentient fungal entities protect and maintain the observatory's legacy. Some serve as guardians, ensuring that only the worthy access the observatory's secrets.

Unbeknownst to many, the key to mending the tear in reality lies within the walls of the Mushroom Observatory. The Mycocelestial Elixir's recipe, vital components, and the process of its creation are scattered throughout, awaiting discovery by brave adventurers. As they journey deeper, they'll uncover the bond between fungi and the cosmos, and the delicate balance that keeps the universe in harmony.

## Arrival
*As the adventurers approach the Mushroom Observatory, they are met with a sprawling expanse of ancient fungal trees with luminescent canopies. The air is thick with a mixture of earthy and otherworldly scents, giving a sense of both the familiar and the unknown. Nestled between the towering mushrooms, a large, dome-like structure emerges, adorned with intricate patterns resembling both constellations and fungal networks. Its entrance, guarded by two statues of fungi scholars, is an archway with a soft glowing barrier that dissipates as the adventurers approach, inviting them into the Chamber of Celestial Echoes.*

## Dungeon layout
The dungeon's rooms are laid out as follows.

## Room 1: Chamber of Celestial Echoes

*As you enter the Chamber of Celestial Echoes, you find yourself in a large, semi-circular room bathed in soft, shifting colors. The walls are adorned with phosphorescent fungal clusters, casting an eerie yet beautiful glow. The ground beneath your feet is made of condensed mycelium, emitting a gentle hum with every step you take. At the room's center stands a massive Mycelium Telescope, its crystalline cap pointing towards the ceiling.*

### Description
The Chamber of Celestial Echoes is a spacious, semi-circular chamber with a high ceiling. The walls are covered in phosphorescent fungi, creating an otherworldly ambiance. The floor is made of condensed mycelium, giving off a faint hum as you move. In the center, the Mycelium Telescope looms, its crystalline cap reaching toward the ceiling.

A mycelial pedestal supports the **Starshroom Compass**, a unique item that rests on it. Patches of soft, spongy moss are scattered around, providing resting spots. Ethereal music plays softly in the background, matching the tune needed to safely lift the compass.

A small alcove in one corner holds a fungal fountain with healing properties. Ancient symbols and carvings decorate the walls, depicting the history of the fungal realm and its celestial connections. The ceiling is adorned with bioluminescent stalactites, resembling a starry night sky.

### Starshroom Compass Interaction

When characters approach the **Starshroom Compass** without humming the ethereal tune heard in the room, they trigger the release of confusing spore clouds. Affected characters require a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or experience vision blur, imposing disadvantage on their actions for 1 minute. The clue to avoid this trap is the echoing ethereal tune: "Harmony with stars is key."

### Mycoscelestial Resonance

Triggered hourly by the alignment of the Fungal Constellations, the resonance lasts five minutes. During this period:
- **Celestial patterns** on the floor glow. Characters standing on these patterns can glimpse the observatory’s history through the **Mycelium Telescope**.
- A **spectral projection of Elyndra** appears during the first resonance, clarifying the significance.
- **Time-marked celestial symbols** on one wall hint at resonance intervals.
- The approaching resonance is signified by echoing sounds growing louder.
- Players must interact with the projection or **Mycelium Telescope** to obtain relevant content about the observatory’s history and Elyndra’s discoveries.

## Room 4: Elyndra's Sanctum of Synthesis

*As you enter Room 4, you find yourself in an elegant and serene chamber. The walls pulse with cosmic energy, casting a soft, otherworldly glow. In the center, a large alchemical setup stands, with channels leading to various spore collection chambers and crystal reservoirs. Above, an oculus opens to show a clear view of the Fungal Constellations, their light focused onto the brewing apparatus.*

### Description
The room is spacious, with walls lined with shelves containing ancient tomes and manuscripts detailing Elyndra's research. One particular text, titled "The Celestial Brew: Elyndra's Observations," offers insights into her discoveries and the significance of the Fungal Constellations. The floor features intricate murals depicting the various stages of Elyndra's brewing process. A crystal fountain sits in one corner, giving off a soft glow and restoring a small amount of health when consumed. In another corner, a delicate crystal chime hangs, releasing harmonious, calming tones when swayed.

In the center of the room, a suspended platform holds a crystal podium. Placing a hand on the podium allows one to feel the pulse of the entire fungal universe. A glowing inscription on the main brewing apparatus reads: "In unity of cosmos and mycelium, true synthesis is achieved." Hidden among the shelves is a rare **Lunar Mycelium Cluster** that provides the user with night vision when consumed.

## Conclusion
Upon completing their mission and crafting the Mycocelestial Elixir, a radiant energy fills the observatory. The rip in their home realm's fabric mends, and a sense of tranquility descends. The observatory, having served its purpose, starts to gently pulse, and over time, it becomes a beacon of light and knowledge, attracting scholars and mystics from all realms. The artifacts the adventurers find within, especially the Fungistar Lens, can act as powerful tools to peer into other dimensions or as protective amulets against cosmic disturbances. The Mushroom Observatory stands as a testament to their journey, a place of learning and a bridge between the world of fungi and the vast cosmos.
